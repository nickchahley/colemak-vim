Colemak key mappings from vim. A modified version of [Joel Esko's configuration](https://github.com/jooize/vim-colemak), itself modified from [Shai Coleman's configuration](http://colemak.com/pub/vim/colemak.vim)

Here the movement keys are mapped to the homerow (neio) vim's traditional left-shifted position (mnei, on colemak-dh)
